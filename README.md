# bigO
If there's only one overarching topic of computer science, it's difficult to not give that award to Big O. Having an efficient algorithm can make the difference between a
program running within a few minutes and the program taking a few years (or even worse, until the heat death of the universe).

## [bogosort](https://github.com/kevinfengcs88/bigO/blob/main/Bogosort.java)
Bogosort is a horrible sorting algorithm, and that's honestly an understatement. Implementing bogosort and testing it for various input sizes can give you an idea of how inefficient it is, and more importantly, why it's
imperative to write efficient code so the problems we set out to solve can actually have their solutions executed within a reasonably short amount of time. My experience with
bogosort and even more inefficient sorting algorithms is detailed in one of my blog posts on Medium, which you can find [here](https://medium.com/star-gazers/de-optimizing-sorting-algorithms-to-o-505d0060f508).
